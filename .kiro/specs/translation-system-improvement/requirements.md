# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the translation system for the Screen Size Checker website to ensure consistent and complete multilingual support across all pages and components. The current system has mixed translation approaches and some missing translations that need to be systematically addressed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the website in different languages, I want all text content to be properly translated so that I can understand and use all features in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page in a supported language THEN all visible text content SHALL be displayed in that language
2. WHEN a user switches languages THEN all dynamic content SHALL update to the new language immediately
3. WHEN a user interacts with forms and tools THEN all labels, placeholders, and error messages SHALL be in the selected language
4. IF a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to English gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want a unified translation system so that I can easily add new content and ensure consistency across all pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new content THEN developers SHALL use a consistent translation key format
2. WHEN translation keys are used THEN they SHALL follow a hierarchical naming convention
3. WHEN components use translations THEN they SHALL use the same translation method consistently
4. IF a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL log the missing key for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to easily identify and fix missing translations so that the website maintains high quality multilingual support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL validate all translation keys are present
2. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL report which keys are missing for which languages
3. WHEN translation files are updated THEN the system SHALL verify the JSON structure is valid
4. IF translation validation fails THEN the build process SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of interactive tools like the PPI calculator, I want all functionality to work correctly in my language so that I can use the tools effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the PPI calculator THEN all input labels and help text SHALL be translated
2. WHEN calculation results are displayed THEN all result labels and units SHALL be in the selected language
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be displayed in the user's language
4. WHEN density categories are shown THEN they SHALL be translated appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want the translation system to be performant and not impact page load times so that users have a good experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN translation processing SHALL not cause noticeable delays
2. WHEN language switching occurs THEN the change SHALL happen within 500ms
3. WHEN translation files are loaded THEN they SHALL be cached appropriately
4. IF translation loading fails THEN the system SHALL retry gracefully without blocking the UI
