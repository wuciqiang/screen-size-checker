# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Aspect Ratio Calculator is a new standalone tool that will be added to our PPI Calculator website. This tool is designed to help users (primarily designers, video editors, and content creators) calculate new dimensions while maintaining a specific aspect ratio. The calculator will be built as a pure static page using our existing component-based architecture, vanilla ES6+ JavaScript, and i18next for localization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to input original dimensions and calculate new dimensions that maintain the same aspect ratio, so that I can resize images or layouts proportionally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters values in Width 1 and Height 1 fields THEN the system SHALL store these as the original aspect ratio
2. WHEN the user enters a value in Width 2 field THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate Height 2 using the formula: Height 2 = (Height 1 / Width 1) * Width 2
3. WHEN the user enters a value in Height 2 field THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate Width 2 using the formula: Width 2 = (Width 1 / Height 1) * Height 2
4. WHEN the user enters non-numeric values THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation messages
5. WHEN the original width or height is zero THEN the system SHALL handle division by zero gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want to see a visual representation of the aspect ratio, so that I can better understand the proportions I'm working with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters valid dimensions THEN the system SHALL display a visual representation of the aspect ratio
2. WHEN the dimensions change THEN the visualizer SHALL update in real-time
3. WHEN invalid dimensions are entered THEN the visualizer SHALL display a default or empty state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to access this tool in multiple languages, so that I can use it regardless of my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN all user-facing text SHALL be localized using i18next
2. WHEN the user switches languages THEN all calculator labels and text SHALL update accordingly
3. WHEN new text is added THEN it SHALL be available in both English and Chinese at minimum

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user searching for aspect ratio tools, I want to find this calculator through search engines, so that I can discover and use this tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is accessed THEN it SHALL have proper SEO meta tags including title and description
2. WHEN search engines crawl the page THEN it SHALL contain structured content explaining aspect ratios
3. WHEN users read the page THEN it SHALL provide educational content about aspect ratios and their common uses
4. WHEN the page loads THEN it SHALL be accessible at the URL `/aspect-ratio-calculator`

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the site, I want the calculator to integrate seamlessly with our existing architecture, so that it follows our established patterns and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculator is implemented THEN it SHALL use the existing component-based architecture
2. WHEN JavaScript is written THEN it SHALL be a modern ES6 module following our patterns
3. WHEN the page is configured THEN it SHALL be added to the pages-config.json file
4. WHEN styles are needed THEN they SHALL integrate with our existing CSS structure
