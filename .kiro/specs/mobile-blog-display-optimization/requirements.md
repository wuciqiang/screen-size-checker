# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the mobile display optimization issues for blog code blocks. While the desktop version displays correctly with proper dark theme styling and single copy buttons, the mobile version shows several problems including incorrect styling, duplicate UI elements, and poor responsive behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mobile Code Block Styling

**User Story:** As a mobile user reading blog posts, I want code blocks to display with consistent dark theme styling and proper formatting, so that the code is readable and visually appealing on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing blog posts on mobile devices THEN code blocks SHALL display with dark background styling consistent with desktop version
2. WHEN viewing code blocks on mobile THEN text SHALL be properly syntax highlighted with appropriate colors
3. WHEN viewing long code lines on mobile THEN horizontal scrolling SHALL be available without breaking the layout
4. IF the device has a small screen THEN code blocks SHALL maintain readability without compromising the overall page layout

### Requirement 2: Mobile UI Element Management

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to see only one set of language labels and copy buttons per code block, so that the interface is clean and functional without duplicate elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing code blocks on mobile THEN each code block SHALL display exactly one language label
2. WHEN viewing code blocks on mobile THEN each code block SHALL display exactly one copy button
3. WHEN JavaScript initializes on mobile THEN duplicate UI elements SHALL be prevented from appearing
4. IF code blocks are dynamically loaded THEN the duplicate prevention mechanism SHALL still function correctly

### Requirement 3: Mobile Touch Interaction

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to easily interact with code block features using touch gestures, so that I can copy code and navigate content efficiently on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tapping the copy button on mobile THEN the code SHALL be copied to clipboard successfully
2. WHEN tapping the copy button on mobile THEN visual feedback SHALL be provided to confirm the action
3. WHEN scrolling horizontally in code blocks THEN touch scrolling SHALL work smoothly without interfering with page scrolling
4. IF the copy button is too small for touch interaction THEN it SHALL be sized appropriately for mobile touch targets (minimum 44px)

### Requirement 4: Mobile Responsive Layout

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want code blocks to fit properly within the mobile layout without causing horizontal page scrolling or breaking the responsive design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing blog posts on mobile THEN code blocks SHALL not cause horizontal page scrolling
2. WHEN code blocks contain long lines THEN they SHALL use internal horizontal scrolling only
3. WHEN the mobile viewport is very narrow THEN code blocks SHALL maintain minimum usability
4. IF the device orientation changes THEN code blocks SHALL adapt appropriately to the new layout

### Requirement 5: Mobile Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user with potentially slower internet connection, I want code blocks to load and render efficiently without impacting page performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading blog pages on mobile THEN code block JavaScript SHALL initialize without blocking page rendering
2. WHEN multiple code blocks exist on a page THEN they SHALL be processed efficiently without performance degradation
3. WHEN code block features are not immediately needed THEN they SHALL be loaded with appropriate priority
4. IF the mobile device has limited resources THEN code block functionality SHALL still work reliably

### Requirement 6: Mobile CSS Media Query Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want code blocks to use mobile-optimized CSS that takes into account smaller screens, touch interfaces, and mobile-specific display characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN mobile-specific CSS rules SHALL be applied to code blocks
2. WHEN the screen width is below tablet breakpoint THEN mobile-optimized spacing and sizing SHALL be used
3. WHEN viewing on high-DPI mobile screens THEN code blocks SHALL render crisply without blur
4. IF the mobile device has specific display characteristics THEN appropriate CSS adaptations SHALL be applied
