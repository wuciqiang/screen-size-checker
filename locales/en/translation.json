Google's mobile-first indexing prioritizes mobile-friendly websites in search results, making responsive design crucial for SEO success. Responsive websites automatically adjust their layout to fit different screen sizes, from smartphones to tablets to desktop monitors, providing optimal user experience across all devices. This approach significantly improves conversion rates by ensuring users can easily navigate and interact with your content regardless of their device. As mobile traffic continues to grow and represents over 50% of global web traffic, implementing responsive design is no longer optional—it's necessary to reach and engage the expanding mobile user base effectively.",

  "faq_heading": "Frequently Asked Questions About Screen Size Comparison",
  "faq_measure_question": "How is screen size measured?",
  "faq_measure_answer": "Screen size is typically measured diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner, expressed in inches or centimeters. For example, a 50\" TV means the diagonal measurement is 50 inches.",
  "faq_difference_question": "What's the difference between screen size and screen dimensions?",
  "faq_difference_answer": "Screen size typically refers to the diagonal measurement, while screen dimensions include the width and height measurements. The actual dimensions depend on the aspect ratio of the screen.",
  "faq_area_question": "How do I calculate screen area?",
  "faq_area_answer": "Screen area is calculated by multiplying the width by the height. Our comparison tool automatically calculates this for you based on the diagonal size and aspect ratio.",
  "faq_different_question": "Why do screens with the same diagonal size look different?",
  "faq_different_answer": "Screens with different aspect ratios will have different widths and heights even with the same diagonal measurement. For example, a 27\" 16:9 monitor is wider but shorter than a 27\" 4:3 monitor.",
  "faq_aspect_question": "What is aspect ratio and why does it matter?",
  "faq_aspect_answer": "Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between a screen's width and height (width:height). Common ratios include 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (traditional), and 21:9 (ultrawide). It matters because it affects how content is displayed and the overall viewing experience.",

    "whatIsPPI": "What is PPI (Pixel Density)?",
    "ppiDefinition": "PPI (Pixels Per Inch) is a unit that measures the pixel density of display devices. It represents how many pixel points are contained within one inch of length. The higher the PPI value, the finer the display effect, and the clearer and sharper images and text appear.",
    
    "howPPICalculated": "How is PPI Calculated?",
    "ppiFormula": "The PPI calculation formula is: PPI = √(horizontal pixels² + vertical pixels²) / diagonal inches. First calculate the pixel diagonal length of the screen, then divide by the physical diagonal length to get the number of pixels per inch.",
    
    "whyPPIImportant": "Why is PPI Important?",
    "ppiImportance": "PPI has a direct impact on display quality. High PPI displays can present clearer text, finer image details, and reduce pixel graininess. For designers and developers, understanding the PPI of target devices helps optimize image resources and ensure optimal display effects on screens of different densities.",

    "ppiVsDpi": "PPI vs DPI: What's the Difference?",
    "ppiVsDpiExplanation": "PPI and DPI are often confused, but they have different application scenarios. PPI (Pixels Per Inch) is mainly used to describe the pixel density of digital display devices, while DPI (Dots Per Inch) is mainly used to describe the resolution of printing devices. In the context of web design and screen display, we typically use PPI to measure display quality.",

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
      "goodPPI": {
        "question": "What is a good PPI for a monitor?",
        "answer": "For general use, 100-150 PPI is adequate. For professional work, 200+ PPI is recommended. Gaming typically works well with 100-200 PPI, while graphic design benefits from 200+ PPI for sharp detail work."
      },
      "higherBetter": {
        "question": "Does a higher PPI always mean better image quality?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. While higher PPI provides sharper images, other factors like color accuracy, contrast ratio, and panel technology also significantly impact overall image quality. Very high PPI can also strain system resources."
      },
      "gamingEditing": {
        "question": "How does PPI affect gaming and video editing?",
        "answer": "For gaming, moderate PPI (100-200) often provides the best balance of sharpness and performance. For video editing, higher PPI (200+ PPI) helps with precise editing and color grading, but requires more powerful hardware."
      },
      "humanEye": {
        "question": "Can the human eye tell the difference between high PPI displays?",
        "answer": "The human eye can typically distinguish up to about 300 PPI at normal viewing distances. Beyond this point, improvements become less noticeable unless viewing very close to the screen."

    "faq1q": "How do I find my projector's throw ratio?",
    "faq1a": "Check your projector's specifications sheet or manual. It's usually listed as a single number (e.g., 1.5) or a range (e.g., 1.2-1.9) for projectors with zoom lenses.",
    "faq2q": "What size screen should I get for my room?",
    "faq2a": "The ideal screen size depends on your viewing distance and room size. A general rule is that the screen diagonal should be about 1/3 to 1/2 of your viewing distance.",
    "faq3q": "Can I use a short throw projector for a large screen?",
    "faq3a": "Yes, but there are trade-offs. Short throw projectors can create large images from short distances, but may have more geometric distortion at larger sizes.",
    "faq4q": "What's the difference between throw ratio and throw distance?",
    "faq4a": "Throw distance is the actual physical distance between the projector and screen. Throw ratio is a multiplier that relates this distance to screen width.",
    "faq5q": "How does aspect ratio affect screen size calculations?",
    "faq5a": "Different aspect ratios have different width-to-height proportions. A 16:9 screen is wider relative to its height than a 4:3 screen."

    "faq1a": "Dead pixels are usually permanent. However, stuck pixels can sometimes be fixed by running pixel-cycling software or gently massaging the affected area with a soft cloth.",
    "faq2q": "How many dead pixels are acceptable?",
    "faq2a": "Most manufacturers allow 1-5 dead pixels depending on screen class. Premium 'zero dead pixel' warranties are available from some brands.",
    "faq3q": "Why test in fullscreen mode?",
    "faq3a": "Fullscreen mode ensures the test covers every pixel and removes UI elements that could hide defects. It also provides accurate color display without browser interference.",
    "faq4q": "What causes backlight bleeding?",
    "faq4a": "Backlight bleed is caused by uneven light distribution from the LED backlight, often due to manufacturing tolerances or pressure on the panel frame."
