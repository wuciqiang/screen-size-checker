  "faq_measure_question": "How is screen size measured?",
  "faq_measure_answer": "Screen size is typically measured diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner, expressed in inches or centimeters. For example, a 50\" TV means the diagonal measurement is 50 inches.",
  "faq_difference_question": "What's the difference between screen size and screen dimensions?",
  "faq_difference_answer": "Screen size typically refers to the diagonal measurement, while screen dimensions include the width and height measurements. The actual dimensions depend on the aspect ratio of the screen.",
  "faq_area_question": "How do I calculate screen area?",
  "faq_area_answer": "Screen area is calculated by multiplying the width by the height. Our comparison tool automatically calculates this for you based on the diagonal size and aspect ratio.",
  "faq_different_question": "Why do screens with the same diagonal size look different?",
  "faq_different_answer": "Screens with different aspect ratios will have different widths and heights even with the same diagonal measurement. For example, a 27\" 16:9 monitor is wider but shorter than a 27\" 4:3 monitor.",
  "faq_aspect_question": "What is aspect ratio and why does it matter?",
  "faq_aspect_answer": "Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between a screen's width and height (width:height). Common ratios include 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (traditional), and 21:9 (ultrawide). It matters because it affects how content is displayed and the overall viewing experience.",
