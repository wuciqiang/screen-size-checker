  "faq_measure_answer": "Screen size is typically measured diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner, expressed in inches or centimeters. For example, a 50\" TV means the diagonal measurement is 50 inches.",
  "faq_difference_question": "What's the difference between screen size and screen dimensions?",
  "faq_difference_answer": "Screen size typically refers to the diagonal measurement, while screen dimensions include the width and height measurements. The actual dimensions depend on the aspect ratio of the screen.",
  "faq_area_question": "How do I calculate screen area?",
  "faq_area_answer": "Screen area is calculated by multiplying the width by the height. Our comparison tool automatically calculates this for you based on the diagonal size and aspect ratio.",
  "faq_different_question": "Why do screens with the same diagonal size look different?",
  "faq_different_answer": "Screens with different aspect ratios will have different widths and heights even with the same diagonal measurement. For example, a 27\" 16:9 monitor is wider but shorter than a 27\" 4:3 monitor.",
  "faq_aspect_question": "What is aspect ratio and why does it matter?",
  "faq_aspect_answer": "Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between a screen's width and height (width:height). Common ratios include 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (traditional), and 21:9 (ultrawide). It matters because it affects how content is displayed and the overall viewing experience.",

  "what_is_resolution": "What is Resolution?",
  "resolution_explanation": "Resolution refers to the number of horizontal and vertical pixels on a display. Higher resolution means more detail but requires more processing power and bandwidth.",
  
  "what_is_aspect_ratio": "What is Aspect Ratio?",
  "aspect_ratio_explanation": "Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between width and height, expressed as x:y (e.g., 16:9). It determines the shape of the display area, affecting viewing experience and content layout.",
  
  "resolution_vs_size": "Resolution vs. Physical Size",
  "resolution_vs_size_explanation": "Resolution is the pixel count, while physical size is the actual dimensions of the screen (usually measured in inches or centimeters). Screens with the same resolution can have different physical sizes, affecting pixel density (PPI/DPI).",
