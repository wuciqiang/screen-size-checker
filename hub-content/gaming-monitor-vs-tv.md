## Common Myths Debunked

### Myth 1: "TVs have terrible input lag"

**Reality**: Modern gaming TVs (2023+) have excellent input lag in Game Mode. LG OLED C3 has 5-6ms input lag at 60Hz, 3-4ms at 120Hz—close to gaming monitors. **Old TVs (pre-2020) did have 30-50ms lag**, giving TVs their bad reputation. Not true anymore for quality gaming TVs.

### Myth 2: "You need a monitor for any competitive gaming"

**Reality**: For **elite esports** (pro level), yes. For **casual competitive** (ranked play), a 120Hz gaming TV with <10ms lag is perfectly fine for most players. The difference between 3ms and 8ms won't make a Gold player reach Diamond. Skill matters more than 5ms lag.

### Myth 3: "Bigger screen is always better for gaming"

**Reality**: False for competitive gaming. Professional gamers use 24-27" monitors because **smaller screens allow easier visual tracking** of the entire screen without eye/head movement. For immersive single-player, bigger is better. For competitive, 24-27" is optimal.

### Myth 4: "Monitors can't do good HDR"

**Reality**: Mostly true but changing. Most gaming monitors have mediocre HDR (HDR400/600). However, **high-end Mini-LED and OLED monitors** (ASUS PG32UQX, LG 27GR95QE) deliver excellent HDR comparable to TVs. Just expensive ($1000-2500).

### Myth 5: "4K gaming on monitor is pointless"

**Reality**: Partially true. At 24-27", the difference between 1440p and 4K is subtle. **At 32"**, 4K provides noticeably sharper image. Also, 4K gaming at 32" requires less GPU power than 4K gaming on 55" TV (same resolution, closer viewing distance makes it "feel" higher resolution on larger screen).

### Myth 6: "OLED TVs have terrible burn-in"

**Reality**: Overstated for gaming use. Modern OLED TVs (2023+) have robust burn-in protection (pixel refresh, logo dimming, screen shift). **For varied gaming content**, risk is low. **For heavy static UI gaming** (MMOs, strategy games with permanent HUDs), risk increases. Most gamers can use OLED safely with basic precautions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is a gaming monitor better than a TV for PS5?

For competitive gaming, yes—monitors have lower input lag (1-3ms vs 5-10ms) and faster response times. For single-player and immersive gaming, TVs are better—larger screen (55"+), superior HDR, and more comfortable couch gaming experience. Most PS5 users prefer TVs for the living room setup, but competitive players choose monitors.

### Can I use a TV as a PC monitor?

Yes, but with considerations. Modern 4K TVs work well as PC monitors for productivity and gaming. However: (1) TVs are large (43"+) requiring more desk space, (2) text clarity may be lower than native monitors at close viewing, (3) some TVs have chroma subsampling issues in PC mode. Best for couch gaming, not ideal for desk work.

### What size monitor is best for gaming?

24" for competitive esports (1080p 144-240Hz), 27" for balanced gaming (1440p 144-165Hz), 32" for immersive gaming (1440p/4K). Larger than 32" becomes unwieldy for desk use. Professional gamers prefer 24-27" for better visual tracking of entire screen without head movement.

### Do gaming TVs have higher input lag than monitors?

Yes, but the gap has narrowed. Best gaming monitors: 1-3ms input lag. Best gaming TVs: 5-10ms input lag. The 4-7ms difference matters in competitive esports but is negligible in casual gaming. Budget TVs (30ms+) still have poor input lag—avoid for gaming.

### Is OLED or QLED better for gaming?

OLED is better for image quality (perfect blacks, infinite contrast, instant response time) but has burn-in risk and costs more. QLED is brighter (better for bright rooms), no burn-in risk, and usually cheaper. For gaming: OLED for best experience, QLED for better value and peace of mind. Both are good choices in 2025.

### Can a 60Hz TV be good for gaming?

For single-player and casual gaming, yes—60Hz is adequate. For competitive gaming, no—60Hz feels sluggish compared to 120Hz+ after acclimation. PS5 and Xbox Series X support 120Hz in many games, making 60Hz TVs a bottleneck. Minimum recommendation: 120Hz for modern console gaming.

### Why do pros use gaming monitors instead of TVs?

Four reasons: (1) Lower input lag (1-3ms vs 5-10ms) for faster reactions, (2) Higher refresh rates (240-360Hz vs max 120Hz TV), (3) Smaller size (24-27") allows tracking entire screen without eye movement, (4) Desk setup is tournament standard. No competitive disadvantages tolerated at pro level.

### Is a curved monitor or TV better for gaming?

Curved monitors (1800R-1000R) provide more immersive experience for desk gaming, reduce eye strain, and improve viewing angles. Most beneficial at 27"+ and ultrawide formats. Curved TVs are rare and unnecessary—viewing distance too great for curve to matter. For desk gaming: curved is nice bonus. For living room: flat is fine.
