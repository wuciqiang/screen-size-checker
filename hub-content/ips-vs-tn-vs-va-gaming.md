## Direct Panel Comparison

### Response Time Reality Check

**Advertised vs Real-World** (TFTCentral Testing):

| Panel Type | Advertised | Actual Average | 90th Percentile |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| TN (Old) | 1ms | 2-3ms | 4-5ms |
| TN (Modern) | 0.5-1ms | 1-2ms | 2-3ms |
| IPS (Standard) | 4ms | 5-6ms | 8-10ms |
| IPS (Fast) | 1ms | 2-3ms | 4-5ms |
| VA (Standard) | 5ms | 8-12ms | 15-20ms |
| VA (Fast) | 3ms | 5-8ms | 10-15ms |
| OLED | 0.1ms | 0.1ms | 0.1ms |

**Key Takeaway**: "1ms" marketing is often misleading. Look for professional reviews with proper response time measurements.

### Competitive Gaming Performance

**Professional Player Panel Usage (2025 Survey)**:

| Panel Type | CS2 Pros | Valorant Pros | Apex Pros | Average |
|------------|----------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| TN | 45% | 38% | 25% | 36% |
| IPS (Fast) | 52% | 58% | 68% | 59% |
| OLED | 3% | 4% | 7% | 5% |
| VA | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

**Trend**: Fast IPS has overtaken TN as the professional standard, with OLED adoption beginning among top earners.

### Color Accuracy Comparison

**Delta E Testing (Lower is Better)**:

| Panel Type | Average ΔE | Rating | Professional Use |
|------------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| OLED | <1.0 | Excellent | ✅ Yes |
| IPS (High-end) | <2.0 | Excellent | ✅ Yes |
| IPS (Mid-range) | 2.0-3.0 | Good | ⚠️ Adequate |
| VA | 3.0-5.0 | Fair | ❌ No |
| TN | 5.0-8.0 | Poor | ❌ No |

**Standard**: ΔE <2.0 considered color-accurate for professional work.

### HDR Performance

**HDR Capability by Panel** (2025 Standards):

| Panel | HDR Standard | Peak Brightness | Local Dimming | HDR Quality |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| TN | HDR400 | 300-400 nits | None | ❌ Poor (avoid) |
| IPS | HDR400/600 | 400-600 nits | Edge-lit | ⚠️ Mediocre |
| IPS (Mini-LED) | HDR1000/1400 | 1000-1400 nits | FALD 512+ zones | ✅ Good |
| VA | HDR600/1000 | 600-1000 nits | Edge/FALD | ⚠️ Good (native contrast helps) |
| OLED | True HDR | 400-1000 nits | Per-pixel | ✅ Excellent |

**Verdict**: OLED and Mini-LED IPS offer true HDR gaming. Standard LCD HDR is mostly marketing.

## Common Myths Debunked

### Myth 1: "You Need TN for Competitive Gaming"

**Reality**: False in 2025. Fast IPS panels (1-2ms) are competitive with TN while offering vastly better image quality. 59% of pros now use Fast IPS. TN advantage is now marginal and only relevant at absolute elite levels.

### Myth 2: "IPS Always Has IPS Glow"

**Reality**: Partially true. Modern IPS has reduced glow significantly. High-quality IPS panels have minimal glow. It's panel lottery—some units better than others. OLED eliminates this completely.

### Myth 3: "VA is Always Slow and Blurry"

**Reality**: Mostly true. While modern VA is faster than old VA, it still suffers from black smearing. Samsung's high-end VA (Odyssey G7/G9) is better but still has issues. VA is inherently slower than IPS/TN.

### Myth 4: "OLED Will Burn-In Immediately"

**Reality**: False. With proper use (varied content, pixel refresh, avoiding static images 24/7), modern OLEDs can last years. LG offers 2-year warranty. Risk exists but is overstated for typical gaming use. Heavy productivity use is riskier.

### Myth 5: "Response Time = Input Lag"

**Reality**: False. Response time is pixel transition speed (affects motion blur). Input lag is processing delay (affects responsiveness). Both matter but are independent. A monitor can have 1ms response but 20ms input lag.

### Myth 6: "Higher Contrast Always Looks Better"

**Reality**: Partially false. Contrast helps dark scenes, but brightness, color accuracy, and uniformity also matter. VA's high contrast is offset by color shift and slower response. OLED's infinite contrast + speed + color = actually better.

## Panel-Specific Issues to Know

### IPS Glow
- Light visible in corners when viewing dark screen
- Worse in dark rooms
- Varies by unit (panel lottery)
- Reduced in modern IPS
- Annoying but usually minor

### VA Black Smearing
- Dark-to-dark transitions lag
- Creates ghosting in dark scenes
- Ironically worst where VA should excel
- No fix—inherent to VA technology
- Deal-breaker for fast gaming

### TN Color Shift
- Colors change based on viewing position
- Must sit perfectly centered
- Vertical angles particularly bad
- No workaround
- Limits use cases severely

### OLED Burn-In
- Permanent image retention possible
- Static elements risky (taskbars, HUDs)
- Varies by usage patterns
- Pixel refresh cycles help
- Manageable with care

## Future Panel Technologies

### MicroLED (Coming Soon)
- Self-emissive like OLED
- No burn-in risk
- Higher brightness than OLED
- Extremely expensive currently
- 2-3 years from gaming monitors

### QD-OLED (Available Now)
- Quantum dot + OLED combination
- Better color volume than WOLED
- Higher brightness potential
- Samsung's answer to LG OLED
- Premium pricing

### Mini-LED LCD (Available Now)
- Thousands of local dimming zones
- Excellent HDR performance
- No burn-in risk
- Still LCD limitations
- Good OLED alternative

## Maintenance and Longevity

### Panel Lifespan Expectations

| Panel Type | Expected Lifespan | Common Failure | Degradation |
|------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| TN | 30,000-50,000 hrs | Backlight fade | Brightness loss |
| IPS | 30,000-60,000 hrs | Backlight fade | Minimal |
| VA | 30,000-50,000 hrs | Backlight fade | Brightness loss |
| OLED | 30,000-100,000 hrs | Pixel wear | Burn-in, brightness |

**Note**: 30,000 hours = 8 hours/day for 10+ years. Most monitors outlast their relevance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is IPS or TN better for gaming?

IPS is better for most gamers in 2025. Modern Fast IPS offers 1-2ms response times (nearly matching TN) with vastly superior color accuracy and viewing angles. TN is only better if you need 360Hz+ on a strict budget. 59% of professional gamers now use IPS vs 36% TN.

### What is the best panel type for competitive gaming?

Fast IPS (1-2ms G2G) at 240Hz+ is optimal for competitive gaming in 2025. It balances TN-like speed with better colors and no viewing angle issues. OLED is even better but expensive. TN remains viable on budget but image quality suffers significantly.

### Is VA good for gaming?

VA is good for single-player immersive gaming (horror, RPGs, space sims) where contrast matters more than speed. VA is poor for competitive or fast-paced gaming due to slow response times (4-8ms) and black smearing. Not recommended for FPS, racing, or action games.

### Do I need OLED for gaming?

No, OLED is not needed but offers the ultimate gaming experience with perfect blacks, instant response, and vibrant colors. IPS provides 85-90% of OLED quality at half the price without burn-in concerns. OLED is worth it for enthusiasts who can afford $1000+ and will use varied content to avoid burn-in.

### What is IPS glow and is it a problem?

IPS glow is light leakage visible in screen corners when viewing dark content in dark rooms. It varies by unit quality and viewing angle. Modern IPS has reduced this issue significantly. It's noticeable but usually minor annoyance, not a deal-breaker for most users. OLED eliminates it completely.

### Can you see the difference between 1ms and 4ms response time?

Most gamers cannot clearly distinguish 1ms from 4ms response time in typical gaming. The difference becomes noticeable above 5-6ms as motion blur increases. Professional competitive players may notice 2-3ms differences. For most gamers, 1-4ms is "fast enough" if other monitor qualities (color, refresh rate) are good.

### Is TN dead for gaming monitors?

Not dead but declining. TN retains advantages in extreme budget 240Hz+ monitors and 360-500Hz esports displays. However, Fast IPS has largely replaced TN in mainstream gaming. Major manufacturers are reducing TN models. By 2026-2027, TN will likely be niche/legacy technology except at extreme refresh rates.

### What panel does my favorite streamer use?

Most popular streamers use IPS or OLED panels because they look better on camera and provide better image quality for viewers. While some competitive streamers use TN for performance, IPS is overwhelmingly preferred for streaming due to superior color reproduction that translates better to video encoding.
