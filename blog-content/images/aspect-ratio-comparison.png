# This is a placeholder for the aspect ratio comparison image
# In production, this would be replaced with an actual PNG image showing:
# Three rectangles side by side demonstrating:
# - 16:9 aspect ratio (traditional widescreen)
# - 16:10 aspect ratio (slightly taller, better for productivity)
# - 3:2 aspect ratio (even taller, great for documents)
