## Why Proper Monitor Setup Matters

Many gamers unknowingly play with suboptimal settings:

**Common problems from poor setup**:
- Playing at 60Hz when your monitor supports 144Hz+
- Input lag from incorrect settings
- Washed-out colors or poor contrast
- Screen tearing despite having adaptive sync
- Eye strain from improper brightness

**What proper setup gives you**:
- ✅ Smoother gameplay at full refresh rate
- ✅ Reduced input lag for competitive advantage
- ✅ Accurate colors and better visibility
- ✅ Tear-free gaming experience
- ✅ Less eye strain during long sessions

---

## Step 1: Physical Setup and Positioning

### Monitor Height and Distance

**Optimal positioning**:
- **Eye level**: Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- **Distance**: Arm's length (20-30 inches / 50-75cm)
- **Angle**: Slight backward tilt (10-20 degrees)
- **Center**: Monitor directly in front, not angled

**For different monitor sizes**:

| Monitor Size | Recommended Distance | Reason |
|--------------|---------------------|--------|
| 24" | 20-24 inches (50-60cm) | See entire screen easily |
| 27" | 24-28 inches (60-70cm) | Comfortable field of view |
| 32" | 28-32 inches (70-80cm) | Prevents neck strain |
| 34" UW | 28-35 inches (70-90cm) | Immersive without overwhelming |

### Desk and Chair Setup

**Ergonomic checklist**:
- [ ] Monitor at correct height (use stand or arm)
- [ ] Chair at proper height (feet flat, thighs parallel)
- [ ] Keyboard and mouse at elbow height
- [ ] No glare or reflections on screen
- [ ] Room lighting not too bright or dark

## Step 2: Windows Display Settings

### Enable Your Full Refresh Rate

**This is the #1 missed setting!** Many gamers have 144Hz+ monitors running at 60Hz.

**Windows 11**:
1. Right-click desktop → Display settings
2. Click "Advanced display"
3. Find "Choose a refresh rate"
4. Select the highest available (144Hz, 165Hz, 240Hz, etc.)

**Windows 10**:
1. Right-click desktop → Display settings
2. Click "Advanced display settings"
3. Click "Display adapter properties"
4. Go to "Monitor" tab
5. Set "Screen refresh rate" to highest available

**Verify it's working**:
- Visit [testufo.com](https://testufo.com)
- Should show your actual refresh rate
- Motion should appear much smoother than 60Hz

### Set Native Resolution

**Always use native resolution for gaming**:
- 1080p monitors: 1920×1080
- 1440p monitors: 2560×1440
- 4K monitors: 3840×2160
- Ultrawide: 3440×1440 or 2560×1080

**How to set**:
1. Right-click desktop → Display settings
2. Under "Display resolution," select native
3. If text is too small, use scaling instead of lower resolution

**Why native matters**:
- Non-native looks blurry (scaling artifacts)
- Input lag can increase
- Image quality degrades significantly

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I use V-Sync with G-Sync/FreeSync?

**In NVIDIA Control Panel**: Turn ON (acts as frame cap at top of VRR range)
**In-game**: Turn OFF (prevents double-buffering lag)

This combination gives you the best of both worlds: tear-free gaming within VRR range and smooth capping at max refresh.

### What's the best response time setting?

**Start at Medium/Normal**, then test with testufo.com/ghosting. Increase if you see ghosting trails. Decrease if you see inverse ghosting (bright coronas). The "1ms" advertised often requires extreme overdrive that causes issues.

### Should I use fullscreen or borderless window?

**Competitive games**: Exclusive fullscreen (lowest input lag)
**Casual/multitasking**: Borderless windowed (alt-tab faster)

Note: Windows 11 optimizations have reduced the difference significantly.

### How do I know if my settings are working?

Use these tests:
- **Refresh rate**: testufo.com (shows actual Hz)
- **G-Sync/FreeSync**: NVIDIA Pendulum or VRR indicator in monitor OSD
- **Response time**: testufo.com/ghosting
- **Input lag**: Feel for responsiveness, or use NVIDIA Reflex

### Is HDR worth enabling?

**Yes if**:
- Your monitor is HDR600 or better
- Game has good HDR support
- You've calibrated HDR settings

**No if**:
- Monitor is only HDR400
- HDR looks washed out
- Game has poor HDR implementation
